# React Router v6 Routes Component Issue

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `Routes` component in React Router v6.  The problem arises from incorrect nesting or improper path definitions within the `Routes` component, preventing nested routes from functioning as expected.

## Problem

The provided `bug.js` file shows an example where nested routes may not render correctly due to the structure and usage of the `Routes` component.  This often leads to unexpected behavior where only the first matching route is rendered, even if a nested path exists. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code that resolves the issue. The solution typically involves ensuring correct route nesting and path definitions within the `Routes` component.  This ensures that all the defined routes are correctly matched and rendered.  See the solution for a demonstration of this principle.
